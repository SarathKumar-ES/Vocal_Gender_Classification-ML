# Vocal_Gender_Classification-ML
A supervised learning project aimed at classifying vocal recordings by gender using vocal features such as pitch, frequency, and modulation. The dataset contains vocal features extracted from various recordings to identify whether the speaker is male or female. 

## 📦 Dataset  
- Source: [Kaggle - Vocal Gender Features](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/murtadhanajim/vocal-gender-features)  
- Features: Various vocal features such as pitch, frequency, etc.  
- Target Variable: `label` (0 = Female, 1 = Male)

## 🚀 Project Objective  
- Develop a predictive model to classify the gender of a speaker based on vocal characteristics.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
